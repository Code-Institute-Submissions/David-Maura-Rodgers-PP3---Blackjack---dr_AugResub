# Blackjack Python Game

My Blackjack game runs through an Heroku Terminal. The game will take in user input and deal cards to both the player and the dealer. 

The rules and conditions for the game are outlined as below:
Cards are drawn from a list data model - [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]
There are no jokers in the deck
The Jack/Queen/King all count as 10.
The Ace can count as 11 or 1

If the computer has a blackjack (0), then the player loses and vice versa
If the player_hand is over 21, then the player loses and vice versa
If none of the above, then the player with the highest hand wins

## How to play
The game begins by asking you if you would like to play a game of Blackjack, if yes, the game begins.

The madatory bet is â‚¬30 and you can bet on top of this if you wish.

Random cards are drawn and and the total value of your cards and the dealer's first card is displayed.

The aim of the game is to get to as close to 21 as possible, closer than the dealer, and without going over the value of 21.

- __Warnings__
  - I received the below from both pages when doing the CSS validator check. They just seem to be toolkit warnings for the icons I am using from Font Awesome (this doesn't affect the user's experience of the site in anyway):
  - moz-osx-font-smoothing is a vendor extension
	- webkit-font-smoothing is a vendor extension
	- ms-filter is a vendor extension
	- ms-filter is a vendor extension

### Unfixed Bugs or Other Quirks

- There doesn't appear to be any bugs with the functionality of the quiz in of itself. I have tested it several times, as can be expected during the time I was developing the script. All seems to work fine and all functions called upon appear to work with no problems.

- Font Awesome:
  - As mentioned previously above, I get warnings about vendor extensions with my use of Font Awesome, but nothing that seems to be critical or impedes the functionality of the site for the user.

- However, I have put a lot of work into responsiveness  for this site and have had quite a few challenges, many of which are resolved now. My comments on this are as below:
  - I have had to take the no repeat attribute off the background img for the 1024 px media query as the image would not cover the entire screen as hoped.
  - The icons within the icon area div are generally well centered within its containing div, however on some screens, it can look a bit off kilter. With enough time in the future, I would hope to have this 100%. 
  - I have added media queries for 5 breakpoints (1440px, 1240px, 992px, 576px, 375px) to ensure as much integrity as possible. Screenshots evidence the below:

  ![1440px](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91907661/153282167-9ad76422-ee8f-45af-b5e4-42be52e16138.png)

  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.

- __JavaScript Code__
  - I looked online at W3 Schools and MDN to get a better understanding of JavaScript concepts when writing the script.
  - I had a look at Stack Overflow on numerous occasions, and though I did try several snippets of code in my project, I never ended up using any of it as it never worked as I needed it to for what I was doing
  - I did however, receive a lot of help in the mentor sessions and guidance on similar projects to get started, along with quite a few online tutor sessions to help me through the logic of what I was trying to achieve with my script. My mentor decided that I should look at https://github.com/Jonathanrange/Rock-Metal-Quiz. The ideas in this project helped me get started in building my own project.
